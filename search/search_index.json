All shader code here is written to be valid GLSL or OpenGL Shading Language . We define a few variables which match the ShaderToy environment for ease of testing, but they can be easily adapted as needed. Variables Shader Inputs uniform vec3 iResolution; // viewport resolution (in pixels) uniform float iTime; // shader playback time (in seconds) uniform float iTimeDelta; // render time (in seconds) uniform float iFrameRate; // shader frame rate uniform int iFrame; // shader playback frame uniform float iChannelTime[4]; // channel playback time (in seconds) uniform vec3 iChannelResolution[4]; // channel resolution (in pixels) uniform vec4 iMouse; // mouse pixel coords. xy: current (if MLB down), zw: click uniform samplerXX iChannel0..3; // input channel. XX = 2D/Cube uniform vec4 iDate; // (year, month, day, time in seconds) These are the uniforms defined by ShaderToy , and the shader examples in this library use them, as mentioned before, for ease of testing. Other shading langages, such as Godot's shader language, are quite similar to GLSL, and therefore easy to adapt these shaders to. Contributing All contributions are welcomed, and the contribution guide can be viewed on the github repository . This library is built by developers for developers, and we appreciate everyone's help.

Vertex shaders are responsible for running on vertices, or the points in our 3D model for example. They might handle converting world coordinates into screen-space coordinates, or perhaps procedural geometry deformation. They also pass a lot of data into fragment shaders, to enable them function properly (such as colors, or UVs).","title":"Vertex Shaders"},{"location":"Vertex/#vertex-shaders","text":"Vertex shaders don't get a lot of recognition, but they are integral to how we see graphics, especially 3D graphics.
