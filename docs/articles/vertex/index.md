# Vertex Shaders

Vertex shaders don't get a lot of recognition, but they are integral to how we see graphics, especially 3D graphics.

Vertex shaders are responsible for running on vertices, or the points in our 3D model for example. They might handle converting world coordinates into screen-space coordinates, or perhaps procedural geometry deformation.

They also pass a lot of data into fragment shaders, to enable them function properly (such as colors, or UVs).
