# Post Processing Shaders

Post processing shaders are exactly what they sound like. These shaders run after (post-) initial processing happens. Instead of affecting how objects are drawn, they can apply final visual effects before the user sees the frame.

Post processing effects can include:

- [Bloom](Bloom.md)
- [Chromatic Aberration](ChromaticAbberation.md)
- Motion Blur
- Sharpening
- [Vignette](Vignette.md)

and a lot of other very cool stuff.
